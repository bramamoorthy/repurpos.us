    ReFRAME partnerships are determined on a case-by-case basis to avoid redundant screens, minimize compound consumption and ensure proposed assays have the requisite quality.  Successful partner screens will meet the following requirements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Relevant to Global Health
    </li>
    <li>
      Execute a Material Transfer Agreement that ensures global access to data generated by the screen (12-month delay before deposition of data onto a public database maintained by Calibr (<a routerLink="/">reframedb.org</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
      Differentiated assay from prior or on-going screens (e.g. Pathogen species tested, clinical isolate vs. lab-adapted strain, lifecycle stage, assay readout (proliferation vs viability, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Miniaturized and optimized to suit limited compound supply
      <ul>
        <li>
          Assay volume less than 50 &micro;L (384- or 1536-well format)
        </li>
        <li>
          Assay amenable to a single point screen and < 1% hit rate follow-up </li> </ul> </li> </ul>

          <p>
            If approved, the typical screening partner receives ~0.5 nanomoles of each compound during primary screening (i.e., 50 nL @ 10 mM) and up
            to 4 nanomoles for “hits” during the entire campaign (includes primary screen, dose response reconfirmation and counter screen).  For more information contact <a href="mailto:reframescreens@scripps.edu">reframescreens@scripps.edu</a>.
